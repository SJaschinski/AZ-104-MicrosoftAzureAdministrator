# Module 01 Demonstration: Working with PowerShell LoÂ­cally 

In this demonstration, we will install Azure Az PowerShell module. The
Az module is available from a global repository called the PowerShell
Gallery. You can install the module onto your local machine through the **Install-Module** command. You need an elevated PowerShell shell prompt to install modules from the PowerShell Gallery.

### Install the Az module  
  
1.  Open the **Start** menu, and type **Windows PowerShell**.
2.  Right-click the **Windows PowerShell** icon, and select **Run as administrator**.
3.  In the **User Account Control** dialog, select **Yes**.
4.  Type the following command, and then press Enter. This command installs the module for all users by default. (It\'s controlled by the scope parameter.) AllowClobber overwrites the previous PowerShell module.

``` posh
Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
```

### Install NuGet (if needed) 
  
1.  Depending on the NuGet version you have installed you might get a prompt to download and install the latest version.
2.  If prompted, install and import the NuGet provider.

### Trust the repository 

1.  By default, the PowerShell Gallery isn\'t configured as a trusted repository for PowerShellGet. The first time you use the PowerShell Gallery, you will see the following prompt:

> You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from \'PSGallery\'?

2.  As prompted, install the modules.

### Connect to Azure and view your subscription information 

1.  Login to Azure 

``` posh
Connect-AzAccount
# alias Login-AzAccount
# alias Add-AzAccount
```

2.  When prompted provide your credentials
3.  Verify your subscription information 

``` posh
Get-AzSubscription
```

### Create resources 

> **Note:** We will talk more about resource groups in an upcoming lesson.

1.  Create a new resource group. Provide a different location if you like. The *name* must be unique within your subscription. The *location* determines where the metadata for your resource group will be stored. You use strings like "West US", \"North Europe\", or "West India" to specify the location; alternatively, you can use single word equivalents, such as westus, northeurope, or westindia. The core syntax is:

``` posh
New-AzResourceGroup -Name Test -Location westeurope
```

2.  Verify your resource group 

``` posh
Get-AzResourceGroup
```

3.  Remove your resource group. When prompted, confirm.

``` posh
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name Test
```
